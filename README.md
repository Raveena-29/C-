# C++
## ABOUT C++ PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
- C++ developed in 1979
- In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, began work on "C with Classes", the predecessor to C++.
- C++ is a general purpose(it has a wide variety of use cases and is used in large areas.) object-oriented programming language.
- It is a middle-level langauge, as it encapsulates both high and low level language features.
- C++ supports both procedural and object oriented programming paradigms. Therefore, C++ is also called a hybrid language.
- C++ is a Must for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer.
- C++ is very close to hardware, so you get a chance to work at a low level which gives you a lot of control in terms of memory management, better performance and finally robust software development.
- Some of today's most visible used systems have their critical parts written in C++.
  - Bloomberg (Financial formation)
  - Amazon(Web commerce)
  - Google (Web Search)
  - Facebook (Social Media)
- C++ is used to create games and graphics.
- C++ is used in ATM machines from which you withdraw cash.

 ## Let's write some code
 <br>
 
```
 #include <iostream>
 using namespace std;
 int main(){
      cout<<"Hello World";
      return 0;
 }
```
**OUTPUT** :Hello World

<br>

<details>
<summary>Let's break up the code to understand it better</summary>

**Line 1** : 
-  #include <iostream> is a header file library that lets us work with input and output objects, such as cout(used in line 4 in the code).
-  Header files add functionality to C++ programs.
  <br>

**Line 2** :
- Using namespace std means that we can use names for objects and variables from standard library.
  <br>
  
**Line 3** :
- int main() is a function.
- Any code inside its curly brackets{} will be executed.
- main() function is the starting point of any C++ program.
  <br>

**Line 4** :
- cout (pronounced "see-out") is an object used together with the insertion operator (<<) to output/print text.
- In our example it will output "Hello World".
  <br>
**NOTE** : Every C++ statement ends with a semicolon (;)
<br>

**Line 5** :
- return 0 ends the main function
- Whenever the return type of a function is not void , we return some value.
- In this example , return type is int and we return 0.
  <br>

**Line 6** :
- Do not forget to add the closing curly bracket } to actually end the main function.
